# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Step 1: Install Git If you donâ€™t have Git installed, download and install it from git-scm.com.

Step 2: Install Node.js and npm Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from nodejs.org. The npm package manager comes bundled with Node.js.

Step 3: Clone the Repository 

Step 4: Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).

Step 5: Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the cd command. For example: cd path/to/your/directory 

Step 6: Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL. For example: git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git .Replace username and repository-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name. 

Step 7: Navigate into the Project Directory. After cloning, navigate into the project folder using command - cd repository-name 

Step 8: Install Dependencies. Run the following command to install the project dependencies specified in the package.json file: npm install 

Step 9: Start the Development Server.Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React application by running: npm startThis command usually opens the app in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Step 10: Explore the Application. Now you can interact with your React application locally! Make any changes you want in your code editor and see them reflected in your browser.

Install Git and Node.js. Clone the repository using git clone. Navigate into the project directory. Run npm install to install dependencies. Use npm start to run the application.
